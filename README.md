# Crime and demographic driven decisions

## Introduction
I just moved to the United States and I thought this would be a great opportunity to try to predict crime in some of the cities I was looking at living in. I prefer to live in the city with the lowest crimes of course!

The jupyter notebook in this repository contains all of the code and steps I took for this project.

## Sources
In this project I used US census data, state data, and crime data from these three sources.
